                       probably in your OS' package system, 
                       e.g sudo apt-get install libfcgi-dev

== Install ==

1. runghc Setup.hs configure --bindir=/home/user/public_html/
2. runghc Setup.hs build
3. runghc Setup.hs install

You may need to change the line in main if you have lambdabot installed
in a different place than the fastcgi executable.
