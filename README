GOA ~~ GHCi On Acid
===================

This set of tools is an attempt to bring the wonderful world of lambdabot
commands to the GHC interpreter for ease of use.

The set of commands carefully developed in lambdabot during the years has
become a very useful tool for haskellers. For some it is like an addiction.

Installation
------------

-- Add the path to lambdabot's directory to dot-ghci
    $ vi dot-ghci

-- Build
    $ chmod +x Setup.hs
    $ ./Setup.hs configure --prefix=/home/dons
    $ ./Setup.hs build
    $ ./Setup.hs install

-- Add dot-ghci to your default ghci setup. Change setLambdabotHome 
-- according to where your lambdabot is.
    $ cat dot-ghci >> ~/.ghci

Use
---

    $ ghci

    Prelude.foldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
    Prelude.foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
    Data.List.foldl' :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a


Extending
---------

    Define new commands with:

        :def command lambdabot "lambdabot-command-name"

Documentation
-------------

The documentation ought to be compliant with the specification of
khjk-structured-text by Sven Moritz Hallberg <http://www.khjk.org/~sm/>.

Dependencies
------------

[Lambdabot]: <http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/lambdabot/>.
[khjk-structured-text]: If you want to produce HTML documentation.

Additional Fun
--------------

Look in fcgi for a fastcgi binding for lambdabot.
